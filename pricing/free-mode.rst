Free mode
~~~~~~~~~

The Free mode of the IDE contains all the features, but you can store only ``200`` files in a single project.

The files and folders that start with a dot (``.``) are ignored. For example, the database files of a Git repository (inside a ``.git`` folder) do not affect the number of files allowed in the project. The ``node_modules`` folders are ignored by default too.
