Advanced JavaScript editing features
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

By default, the |MonacoEditor|_ only analyzes a single file, the one is open. In |PhaserEditor|_ we did an extra work to allow the |MonacoEditor|_ to analyzes the whole project. This means, the JavaScript editor will show the auto-completion of elements defined in any file of the project, including the Phaser_ types.
