Updating the editor
-------------------

When you start the server, it connects with the updates site in Internet and checks if there is a new version. If there is a new version then it shows a message with the version number and some headlines of the release notes.

For |core|_, we recommend installing/updating the editor via the `phasereditor2d-launcher <https://www.npmjs.com/package/phasereditor2d-launcher>`_ NPM package.

The |allInOne|_ distribution shows a message when there is a new update, but you should download the new version manually.
