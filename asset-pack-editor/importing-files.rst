Before you can use a file in your game, you must create a configuration entry for it in an |AssetPackFile|_.  This is called **importing** the file.

You can import a file using the Asset Pack Editor's `Main toolbar <import-from-main-toolbar.html>`_ or `Blocks view <import-from-blocks-view.html>`_, 
or using the `Files view <import-from-files-view.html>`_.  We'll discuss each of these in the following sections.

A special section discusses the advantages of importing scripts using the |AssetPackFile|_: `Importing JavaScript files <import-scripts.html>`_.

You can un-import a file, removing its |AssetPackFile|_ entry, by pressing the ``Delete`` key in the |AssetPackEditor|_ or the `Outline view <outline-view.html>`_, or from their context menus.
