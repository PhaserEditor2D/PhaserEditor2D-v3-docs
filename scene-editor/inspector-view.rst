Inspector view
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The **Inspector**, is a `general view <../workbench/inspector-view.html>`_ for showing the properties of the objects selected in other parts of the IDE.

When the |SceneEditor|_ is active, the Inspector view shows the properties of the objects selected in the scene.

It groups the properties in sections:
