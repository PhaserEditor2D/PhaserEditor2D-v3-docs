`Spine <https://esotericsoftware.com>`_ is a popular and powerful editor for making 2D skeletal animations. It provides an `official runtime <https://esotericsoftware.com/spine-phaser>`_ for Phaser_.

The Spine_ Phaser runtime provides a rich set of features for loading, controlling and customizing the Spine_ animations in a Phaser_ game. All these features are available to you via the runtime API. In |PhaserEditor|_, as a plus, we are including the basic and most important features into the visual tools. This is a gradual process, but the current set of Spine_ features supported by |PhaserEditor|_ will help you to integrate the Spine_ animations in your games and boost your productivity.
