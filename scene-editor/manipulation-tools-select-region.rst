Select Region tool
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This tool allows you to draw a region in the scene and select all objects inside that zone. You can select it in the toolbar, the context menu or by pressing the ``Shift+S`` keys. If you keep pressing the `Ctrl` key, the previous selected objects will remain selected.
