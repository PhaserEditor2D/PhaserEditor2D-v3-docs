Slice tool
~~~~~~~~~~

This is a tool for changing the size of the slices of a `NineSlice <nine-slice-object.html>`_ object. You can activate it in the context menu, with the **Tools â†’ Slice Tool** option. Or you can activate it in the Nine Slice properties section, by clicking the **Edit Slices** button:

The tools shows four maniputaros for changing the size of the slices:

If you want to change the width of the **left** and **rigth** slices at the same time and with the same value, you can press and hold the ``Shift`` key. It also applies to the height of the **top** and **bottom** slices.

If the object is in a 3 slices mode, it only shows the manipulators for the width slices:
