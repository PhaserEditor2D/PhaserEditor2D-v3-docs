As we mentioned in previous sections, a prefab_ extends a Phaser_ built-in type or another prefab_. This means a prefab_ inherits the properties defined in the Phaser_ built-in types. However, you have the option to define new properties.

With prefab_ user properties, you can create more reusable prefabs_. You can express gameplay concepts: the "health" of a player, the "value" of a coin, the "speed" of an enemy, etc.
