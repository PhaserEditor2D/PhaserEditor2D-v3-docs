The scene has different properties that are not part of the editor or the compiler.

The properties are shown in the |InspectorView|_ when no object is selected. It means, if you click on a blank space of the scene or press the ``ESC`` key, the scene properties will be shown.

The compiler settings are covered in the `Scene Compiler chapter <scene-compiler.html>`_.
