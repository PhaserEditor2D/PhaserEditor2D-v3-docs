The new created component has a default name, so probably you would like to change it, in the |InspectorView|_.

As you can see in the image, the components are shown in a viewer and are rendered like class declarations: with the class name and the name and type of the properties.

To delete a component select it and press the ``Delete`` key. Or select the **Delete** option in the context menu.
