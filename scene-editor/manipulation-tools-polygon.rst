Polygon tool
~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Polygon tool (that you can activate with the ``Y`` key) shows the polygon's points in the scene. It allows you:

* Change the position of a point: drag the point with the mouse cursor.
* Delete a point: move the mouse cursor over the point and press the `Delete` key (or double click). When the cursor is over the point, it is painted in red color.

* Add a new point: move the mouse cursor over a line. It shows a white handler under the cursor, you can drag it for creating a new point.
