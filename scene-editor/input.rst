Input
-----

We are exploring on the ways of helping you with the handling of the input of your game. As a start, we are supporting the `Phaser.Input.Keyboard.Key <https://newdocs.phaser.io/docs/3.55.2/Phaser.Input.Keyboard.Key>`_ API in the |SceneEditor|_ and the `Hit Area of an object <./input-hit-area.html>`_.
