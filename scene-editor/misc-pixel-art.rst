Enabling pixel art rendering
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The |SceneEditor|_ runs a Phaser game for rendering the scene. By default, |PhaserEditor|_ renders the scene with antialiasing disabled, which is the optimal configuration for pixel-art-based games. If your game is not using pixel art, then you can disable antialiasing by running the command **Disable Pixel Art Rendering**. You can enable it back with the command **Enable Pixel Art Rendering**. Once you run any of these commands, you have to reload (``Ctrl+R``) the editor.
