Numeric input field
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can change the value of a numeric input fields in different ways:

- By writing a new value in the input field.
- By rolling the mouse wheel over the input field.
- By dragging the mouse over the input field's label.

In the last two methods, the value will be increased or decreased by a certain amount. The amount depends on the domain of the values of the property associated with the input field. For example, if the property is a float between 0 and 1, the value will be increased or decreased by 0.01. If the property is an integer, the value will be increased or decreased by 1.
