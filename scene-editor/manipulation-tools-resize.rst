Resize tool
~~~~~~~~~~~

This tool allows for changing the size of some objects like `TileSprite <tile-sprite-object.html>`_, `Rectangle <shape-object.html#rectangle>`_, and `Ellipse <shape-object.html#ellipse>`_.  You can activate it in the context menu or with the ``Z`` key. Resize the object is not the same of scaling it.
