Animation Key property type
```````````````````````````

This type is just like the `Asset Key property type <prefab-user-properties-asset-key-type.html>`_ but the dialog only shows the animations defined in the project.

Next to the animation key field, there is a button for selecting the animation key and a button for previewing the selected animation:
