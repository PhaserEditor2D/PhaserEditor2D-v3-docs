Open source & commercial
------------------------

|PhaserEditor|_ v3, like the general of web applications, has two layers, the back-end (or server) and the front-end (or client).

The back-end is a tiny bridge between the editor and certain operating system resources, like the file-system and third-party editors. It also deals with the commercial license keys. Its source is not available to the public.

The front-end is the most important (and bigger part) of the product. It contains the IDE workbench and all the plugins. It is open-source, has the MIT license and we welcome any collaboration on it. It is hosted on GitHub and is the main place to request features or report bugs.
