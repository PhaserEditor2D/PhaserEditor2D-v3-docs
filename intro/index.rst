|PhaserEditor|_ is an IDE to build 2D HTML5 games. The games are based on the popular and open source framework Phaser_ (version 3).

|PhaserEditor|_ v3 is the latest version of the IDE, and is a complete re-write in a new technology: the web.

Previous versions of the IDE was made on top of the |EclipseIDE|_ platform and included a lot of tools from this platform and other we developed. However, we changed our philosophy of bundle all kind of tools in the same product, and now the IDE is focused on design tools, especially, the |SceneEditor|_.
