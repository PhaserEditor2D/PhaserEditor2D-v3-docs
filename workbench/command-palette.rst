Command palette
---------------

The `Command palette`_ is a dialog that shows the commands available in the **current context**. You can open it by pressing ``Ctrl+K`` or clicking on the **Command Palette** option of the |MainMenu|_.

Not all commands are shown, those that do not apply to the **current context** (active view, active editor or active dialog) are omitted.

In the dialog, you can select a command and execute it by pressing the **Execute** button.
